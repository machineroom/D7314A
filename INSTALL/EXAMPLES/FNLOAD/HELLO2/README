parents.  The calling sequences amongst the files is as follows:


    hello.c
      |
      |
      V
    hello1.c
      |
      |
      V
    hello2.c
      |
      |
      V
    hello3a.c ----> hello1.c
                      |
                      |
                      V
                    hello2.c
                      |
                      |
                      V
                    hello3b.c ---> hello1.c
                                     |
                                     |
                                     V
                                   hello2.c
                                     |
                                     |
                                     V
                                   hello3c.c



Note the re-use of hello1.c and hello2.c.

Note also that this example is too large to run on a 16-bit transputer.
